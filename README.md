# WC3_Loader
A small Loader for Warcraft III

Check out the Discord : https://discord.gg/N9rjQ6r if you have some question!

You only need to download the ahk file (if you have ![autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed)

Otherwise, just download the exe file directly

So far it allows you to load in :

- Gaia ORPG :
