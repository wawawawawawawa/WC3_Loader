1.0 : Created the Loader
1.1 : Added Version Updater
1.2 : Added Backup Tool
      the exe now returns 2/68 on totalvirus... ah well, creating a backup is considered "stealing"...
      at least the .ahk is still 0/68 :)
1.3 : Added Progress Bar and some bugfixes
1.4 : Added AutoInstaller
      the autoupdater.exe shows 3/68 on totalvirus (same ones than from the backup version)...
      the ahk version is still 0/68 (and only 10 lines of code :p), so check the code there, or just never click on "Automatic Install" button
