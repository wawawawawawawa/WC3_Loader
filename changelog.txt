1.0 : Created the Loader

1.1 : Added Version Updater

1.2 : Added Backup Tool
      The WC3 RPG Loader.exe now returns 2/68 on virustotal...
      Ah well, creating a backup is considered "stealing"...
      At least the WC3 RPG Loader..ahk is still 0/68 :)
      
1.3 : Added Progress Bar and some bugfixes

1.4 : Added AutoInstaller
      The AutoUpdater.exe shows 3/68 on totalvirus 
      (same ones than from the backup version)...
      The AutoUpdater.ahk shows 0/68 though (and only 10 lines of code :p)
      You can check the code on the ahk, or just never use the .exe version :)
      
1.5 : Added TeveF RPG

1.6 : Added Icon and Tray Icon

1.7 : Added more Options
      Added Self-Signed Certificate on the .exe
      Added incentive to use the .ahk over the .exe
      (btw only 1/68 from virustotal on each exe now :D)

1.8 : Added Theme
      Writting "-save" automatically refresh current opened loader

1.9 : Added GoH RPG
